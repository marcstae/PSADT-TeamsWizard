# PSADT-TeamsWizard

This is a learning project I undertook in my time at the Workplace team as a part of my apprenticeship @Aveniq.

## Key Features

Note: This project is by no means perfect and was just a proof of concept for myself.

This whole project is about taking a preexisting .exe or .msi and implementing it into a Powershell script that automatically installs it on a customer pc without him having to configure anything afterwards.

## Current state (03.10.2022)

When running the script it will automatically install TeamsWizard without any setup procedure - the current configuration is the same as the out of box version with one small little change.

If you're using the fast dial feature of TeamsWizard you now have to press Shift + F8 to actuate it, normally you only have to press F8.

## How to run this script

Simply download the whole project and execute it in administator mode
