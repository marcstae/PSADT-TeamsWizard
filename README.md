# PSADT-TeamsWizard

This is a learning project I undertook in my time at the Workplace team as a part of my apprenticeship @Aveniq.



## Key Features

Note: This project is by no means perfect and was just a proof of concept for myself.

This whole project is about taking a preexisting .exe or .msi and implementing it into a Powershell script that automatically installs it on a customer pc without him having to configure anything afterwards.
